# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Rust

This repository is dedicated to my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. The primary focus of this project is to explore and deepen my understanding of Rust development.

## Index

- [Day 1](./Day1)
- [Day 2](./Day2)

## Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in its own directory with the following structure:

- `DayX`
  - `src`
    - `main.rs` (Rust source code for the day's solution)
  - `Cargo.toml` (Rust project configuration file)
  - `input` (Input data for the challenge)

Replace `X` with the day number. The same structure is replicated for all days of the challenge.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day, navigate to the day's directory and use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:

```bash
cd DayX
cargo run --release
```

This command compiles the Rust program and runs it with the input file provided.

# Contributions

While these solutions are primarily for my personal learning and exploration, suggestions and discussions are welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have any improvements or ideas.
